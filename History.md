### Upgrade Notes
This release contains two breaking changes:

#### 1. Subscription Change Objects
To update a subscription, a SubscriptionChange object must be passed into the `ChangeSubscription()` method.
See the C# example in our [dev docs](https://dev.recurly.com/docs/update-subscription).

#### 2. Address requires empty string to clear values
In the past, if you were to leave a value such as `FirstName` null, it would nullify it via the API.
Now, you must explicitly nullify it by setting it to empty string `""`. See [this conversation](https://github.com/recurly/recurly-client-net/pull/368#discussion_r246890848) for an example.

1.11.0 (stable) / 2018-03-11
===============

- API v2.10 changes

### Upgrade Notes

This version brings us up to API version 2.10. There are quite a few breaking changes:

#### 1. InvoiceCollection

When creating or failing invoices, we now return an InvoiceCollection object rather than an Invoice. If you wish to upgrade your application without changing functionality, we recommend that you use the `ChargeInvoice` property on the InvoiceCollection to get the charge Invoice. Example:

```csharp
// Change this:
var invoice = account.InvoicePendingCharges();

// To this
var invoiceCollection = account.InvoicePendingCharges();
var invoice = invoiceCollection.ChargeInvoice;

// Invoice.MarkFailed now returns a new collection
// Change this
invoice.MarkFailed();

// To this
var invoiceCollection = invoice.MarkFailed();
var failedInvoice = invoiceCollection.ChargeInvoice;
```

#### 2. Invoice `Subtotal*` changes

If you want to preserve functionality, change any use of `Invoice#SubtotalAfterDiscountInCents` to `Invoice#SubtotalInCents`. If you were previously using `Invoice#SubtotalInCents`, this has been changed to `Invoice#SubtotalBeforeDiscountInCents`.

#### 3. Invoice Refund -- `refund_apply_order` changed to `refund_method`

The `RefundOrderPriority` enum was changed to `RefundMethod`. Change use of `RefundOrderPriority.Credit` to `RefundMethod.CreditFirst` and `RefundOrderPriority.Transaction` to `RefundMethod.TransactionFirst`.


#### 4. Invoice States

If you are checking `Invoice#State` anywhere, you will want to check that you have the new correct values. `collected` has changed to `paid` and `open` has changed to `pending`. Example:

```csharp
// Change this
if (invoice.State == Invoice.InvoiceState.Collected) {
// To this
if (invoice.State == Invoice.InvoiceState.Paid) {

// Change this
if (invoice.State == Invoice.InvoiceState.Open) {
// To this
if (invoice.State == Invoice.InvoiceState.Pending) {
```

#### 5. Invoices on Subscription Previews

If you are using `Subscription#Invoice` on subscription previews, you will need to change this to use `Subscription#InvoiceCollection`. To keep functionality the same:

```csharp
// Change this
subscription.Preview();
var invoice = subscription.Invoice;

// To this
subscription.Preview();
var invoice = subscription.InvoiceCollection.ChargeInvoice;
```

1.10.0 (stable) / 2018-03-06
===============

- Fix unit amounts exceptions when using percentage addons
- Add filter to InvoiceList, redemption updated_at
- Changed Coupon.Id from int to long
- Implement Account Acquisition

### Upgrade Notes

There is one very small breaking change. Coupon.Id changed from an `int` to a `long`. Your code will require a change if you explicitly reference it as an int.

1.9.1 (stable) / 2018-01-22
===============

- Set errors variable to a default instance of the Errors class
- Handle empty revenue_schedule_type

1.9.0 (stable) / 2017-10-26
===============

- Add missing 'DinersClub' credit card type
- Fix creation of an empty invoice when InvoiceList is empty
- Make optional ints nullable
- API v2.9 changes
- Fix revenue_schedule_type spelling

### Upgrade Notes

This version brings us up to API version 2.9. There is a small set of breaking changes coming from PR #263. These properties have been converted to nullable so you may have to unwrap them to use them:

- AddOn#DefaultQuantity
- Plan#PlanIntervalLength
- Plan#TrialIntervalLength
- GiftCard#BalanceInCents



1.8.0 (stable) / 2017-10-26
===============

* Adds giftcard redeem endpoint
* Update the README with `Overview` section
* Make TrialRequiresBillingInfo an optional
* Implements missing `revenue_schedule_type`

### Upgrade Notes

There is one small breaking change in this API version. `TrialRequiresBillingInfo` is now an optional so you will have to unwrap it to use it.


1.7.0 (stable) / 2017-10-17
===============

This release will upgrade us to API version 2.8.

* ImportedTrial flag on Subscription
* Purchases Notes Changes

### Upgrade Notes

There are two breaking changes in this API version you must consider. 

#### Country Codes
All `Country` fields must now contain valid [2 letter ISO 3166 country codes](https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html). If your country code fails validation, you will receive a validation error. This affects any endpoint where an address is collected.

#### Purchase Currency
The purchases endpoint can create and invoice multiple adjustments at once but our invoices can only contain items in one currency. To make this explicit the currency can no longer be provided on an adjustment, it must be set once for the entire purchase:

```csharp
// You must set the currency here
var purchase = new Purchase(accountCode, currency);

var adj = new Adjustment(4000, "HD Camera", 5);
// You can no longer set the currency on the adjustment level
adj.Currency = currency;
purchase.Adjustments.Add(adj);
```

1.6.1 (stable) / 2017-10-04
===============

* Fix Subscription#Postpone datetime format bug


1.6.0 (stable) / 2017-09-06
===============

* Gift Card Support
* Purchases Endpoint Support

### Upgrade Notes

This release will upgrade us to API version 2.7. There is only 1 breaking change in this library.

`Invoice` will now use an enum for the `CollectionMethod` property instead of a string. The enum has 2 values (Automatic and Manual). Example:

```csharp
// Setting
invoice.CollectionMethod = Invoice.Collection.Manual;

// Getting
if (invoice.CollectionMethod == Invoice.Collection.Automatic)
{
  // do something
}
```

1.5.1 (stable) / 2017-06-27
===============

* Fixed NullReference error on List() when page size = 1

1.5.0 (stable) / 2017-06-07
===============

* Added account balance endpoint
* Added plan and subscription changes
* Fixing NullReferenceException in List() functions
* Fixed a probable NRE in Plans.List()
* Remove X-Records Header and RecurlyList #Capacity method

### Upgrade Notes

This release will upgrade us to API version 2.6. There are two breaking changes:

1. To speed up your listing requests we’re no longer automatically computing the record counts for each requests. For our larger sites this could halve the response time. So in this release, we are removing the `RecurlyList#Capacity` method.
to be cached for you. For more info see [PR #324](https://github.com/recurly/recurly-client-ruby/pull/324).
2. For `POST /v2/subscriptions` Sending `null` for `total_billing_cycles` attribute will now override plan `total_billing_cycles` setting and will make subscription renew forever.
Omitting the attribute will cause the setting to default to the value of plan `total_billing_cycles`.
